# React-Full-Calendar-with-Events
Create a simple Calendar Application that shows the Country Holidays. You will use a Calendar library that will help you with your UI design for showing the Calendar view. The Holidays for a specific Country can be fetched by making an API call and the response received can be mapped to your Calendar library bypassing the data in the appropriate format. The application needs to be built in React JS as this Internship leading to Job program is for a MERN Stack developer. The Calendar library that you can use in your React JS application can be React Big Calendar. Or you can use anything similar. To get the Holidays data you can use the https://calendarific.com/ service. Make a free account on this service and explore the API Documentation. This service returns all the holidays for a particular country in a Calendar year. This response needs to be saved to Redux (if you know about it, it will be a plus). API Call should be made only once; when the country is selected. The Calendar Library when displayed in a Month view should display the Holiday against the particular Day. e.g. if you select Pakistan and in the Calendar View you select Month as August then it should display 14th August as Independence Day. This mapping of holidays should be done using data from the REDUX state. A sample screenshot of how the application should look is given below.
